Units
- We need to specify units. OpenEMS by default uses meters but this could be
  fudged to scale things to inches or something non-metric if we wanted.
+ We should support scaling to enable people to incorporate other objects 
  the model from sources other than pcb-rnd (like mech-cad) for things 
  like the chassis or what ever.

Boundary Conditions (http://openems.de/index.php/FDTD_Boundary_Conditions)
- There are 6 fields because this is the cube that contains the model we are 
  solving.
- Boundary conditions for the environment the model is in must be defined. For 
  antenna's these will be different than for say a filter. There are a few pre-
  coded constants PMC, MUR, PML_8 and etc that we should provide as options. 
  Users can also manually enter any number they want.
- It is important to locate the model at the right distance from the boundary
  box walls. This is actually set by how far up/down/left/right you mesh from 
  the model. For PML it is suggested to use a distance of 1/4 the wavelength
  of the longest frequency involved.
  (In openems's documentation this is actually one of the rules of thumb for 
  meshing.)

Excitation (http://openems.de/index.php/Excitation)
- We want Gaussian excitation for a default. This is what most people will use 
  to plot the spectrum of filter absorbtions and etc. It does this on ports.
- The next most useful excitation is spatial excitiation is the standard 
  excitation. AddExcitation does this but I have honestly not seen it used in 
  an examples. Basically everything uses the SetGaussExcite.

Mesh (http://openems.de/index.php/FDTD_Mesh)
(This is really just a list of exactly the same things stated in the URL
above)
- Mesh density should be at minimum 1/10 of the shortest wavelength being 
  studied. 
- Mesh density shouldn't go finer than 1/15 of the shortest wavelength being 
  studied.
- Mesh density should avoid radical changes. (I believe this is what damns 3D 
  copper and via modeling) Mesh density shouldn't double from one cell to it's
  neighbor.
- For 2D copper (which must be the default and currently is the only fully 
  supported mode.) At the edge of the copper 1/3 of the copper should land
  inside the cell leaving 2/3 outside.
- Please see the last note in boundary conditions about centering the model in
  the mesh.

Graphing (http://openems.de/index.php/Visualization_of_Results)
- Honestly it's just described in that url. I can't condense it.
- There are features missing but I should experiment more before pretending to 
  know something the authors did not.

Dump Boxes (http://openems.de/index.php/Dump_Box_Property)
- The term "box" isn't quite accurate. Supposedly this can be invoked with any
  other primitives but the documentation also says the results are invalid.

N2FF (http://openems.de/index.php/NF2FF)
- Honestly again they did a better than I could. 
- The N2FF lets you map
