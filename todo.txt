Step 1: crunch-mode export plugin development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We need each and every one of the followig points done _before_ the
crunch-mode export plugin development can start. This is a checklist.

1. 2..6 example input (.pcb) files with different simple constructions
   that'd test different output features. Keep each as simple as possible:
   e.g. a single trace line, a single polygon with 6..8 point, a single arc,
   etc.

2. One hand written output file for each of the .pcb files of point 1. that
   contains the expected output. Preferrably these files are byte-to-byte what
   pcb-rnd needs to generate when exporting the given .pcb. You don't need to
   write a converter tool or do anything complicated, just use a text editor
   to write the file and then test if it looks good with openEMS. So for a
   point 1. foo.pcb there would be foo.whatever, which can be loaded in openEMS.

3. A step-by-step explanation of what exactly needs to be done in openEMS
   to check whether an exported file works. Chose simplicity over completeness:
   pick one process/action/method-to-check, probably the most sensitive one,
   that is the most likely to break if the export file is wrong
   and document that one process. Do _not_ assume the reader knows or wants
   to know openEMS, so write down each step, dumbed down, like "file menu, load,
   select the exported file", etc.

4. For each of the export files of point 2., a reference output when it went
   through process 3. It can be an output file from openEMS or a screenshot.

5. If there's anything interesting with an input of 1., please also write a
   short plain text file explaining the trick. E.g. if in point 1 bar.pcb
   you have an arc and openEMS doesn't support arc and you had to approximate
   it with 4 line segments in bar.whatever, there should be a bar.txt explaining
   this and giving some hints on the process, e.g. how many line segments
   should be used, what should happen at corner cases, etc. This file can be
   ommited for real straight-forward examples.

6. All these files should be commited in this directory before I can start.


Step 2: testing with real data and bugfixing
