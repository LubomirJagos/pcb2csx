% rough instructions by Evan Foss

* Install pcb-rnd
* Install OpenEMS with CTB (Circuit Tool Box), and hyp2mat
* Make and go to a convient directory 
mkdir ~/emtesting
cd ~/emtesting
* Download the source to the setup
git clone https://github.com/koendv/hyp2mat/tree/master/eagle/hairpinfilter
cd hairpinfilter
* Move the original results so you can compare against them later
mv hairpinfilter_simulation.png hairpinfilter_simulation.origin.png
* Test that everything you installed works. 
octave demo_hairpin.m
* Compare the file you just made hairpinfilter_simulation.png to hairpinfilter_simulation.origin.png they should have comparable content.
