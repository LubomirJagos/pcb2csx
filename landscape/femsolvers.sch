openems uses it's own format in matlab/ocatve script to process everything including geometry
it's output includes but is not limited to paraview and octave's native grapher + ?gnuplot?

fastmaxwell might be abandonware. the project looks stalled post 2008. no info on mesh or geometry input is obivous on the site.

maxfem is more for FEM mechanical issues like mechancial stresses from magnetics than electrical/rf work

nec2 has frequency limitations and is meant mostly for the design of antennas. sadly versions after 2 are proprietary. this is the only solver i have seen that uses method of moments.

firedrake is cool because it has gpu processing. i question their meshing. as yet i see no em work done in it.

FEniCS is another tool that seems to be mostly for mechanical people. However I like their example work on electromagnetics. 
The one thing I dislike about their work is that the current front end is python.

meep uses scheme. I feel that says everything. it is actively developed. one positive for it is that it supports hdf5 for output.

EMTL is hard to google for some reason http://fdtd.kintechlab.com/en/start is the url
it would be good for modeling semiconductors but they don't really talk about anyting rf or pcb related in the documentation.
T 50400 44500 9 12 1 0 0 0 2
angora is also hard to google to get results look for angoraftdt which should yeald http://www.angorafdtd.org/
i don't like their documentation. it would appear to have been developed over the course of 1 year 2012-2013 and then abandoned.

getdp is run via onelab using gmsh to do the meshing. i am not wild about onelab which is way too gui for me. we want to be able to drive everything from make.

calculix looks like a cfd/fem that someone wrote to do aeronautical work and then later an example of electromagnetics was run on it for show.

Elmer (https://csc.fi/web/elmer/elmer) (http://www.elmerfem.org/) this is able to connect to salome which is nice and lists E&M as a feature but I could not find a single example of it in actual use on E&M via their wiki or examples page.

Code Aster (http://code-aster.org/spip.php?rubrique2) This hooks into salome as well. For the mechanical folks it handles mechanical and thermal stuff. I know people who use it with Salome and love it. Honestly it is all over my head.

gmsh (http://gmsh.info/) is a very well respected mesh generation program for FEM that has a 3D CAD built into it. For some formats it falls back on opencascade.

openfoam is impressive and is aiming to be like comsol interms of it's universality. it is very well documented but none of the people i know in the modeling field have ever used it or even know anyone who has used it.

i know a ton of people who use this and swear by it. the trouble is that all of the more appealing stuff in E&M is ftdt which this has yet to connect to as far as i can tell.

librecad was originally qcad from QT. i liked qcad which had a very short learning curve. i still haven't gotten the hang of librecad for some reason.

freecad is reported by some friends to be best in terms of ease of use compared to openscad and freecad.
I resist it because it uses opencascade which is only lgpl.

openscad is favored by Igor2. It's 3D kernel is opencsg which is distributed seperately.

brlcad is the old and well respected. It is also painful to use a problem they are trying to address with a new gui called archer. 
brlcad supports more cad formats than any other open source program i could find. It has it's own 3D kernel.
they are so well respected openscad, linuxcnc and a few others have their google summer of code projects over seen by brlcad.
